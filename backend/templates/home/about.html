                        Brilliant Academy, a senior secondary school of Science and Arts, established in 2017, has
                        triumphantly accomplished the task of creating a significant mark among the well-established
                        institutions of the town. With an éclat of 100% result in the last AHSEC Final Examination, the
                        Academy has successfully instilled in its students the ability to discover their individual
                        identity that would not only make them sensible but capable enough to contribute to the larger
                        umbrella of world’s growth and development. With the best teaching brains, we are committed to
                        provide the best assistance possible for the progress of the students. We are bent on exploiting
                        the strengths of each of our students to the hilt and to divert each of their weakness into
                        positive direction instilling a value system.
                        The Academy is situated in Chinatalia Road, Ward No. 8, North Lakhimpur. It is a co-educational
                        Senior Secondary School that follows both English and Assamese as the medium of instruction.

                        The Academy believes in one of the ancient Indian philosophies on education, <strong><i>“विद्यां ददाति
                        विनयं” (Education leads to sensibility)</i></strong> and therefore, it is committed to create a spark in the
                        already existing power of reception in the tender minds of the children through an education
                        that follows both modern and traditional techniques. Our vision is to materialize the dreams and
                        aspirations of our students by inculcating values and morality.

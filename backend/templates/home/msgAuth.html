                            It gives me immense joy to present the overview of the experiential learning system of our
                            Academy through this prospectus. A senior secondary school of Science and Arts, Brilliant
                            Academy encourages every child to participate whole-heartedly.
                            Quoting Mandela, I would like to ensure that the education we impart shall not only empower
                            the students for their future endeavors but also shall urge their holistic growth and
                            development. They are encouraged to explore their potentials and achieve their personal best
                            in all the aspects of life. Focusing on the development of their individual identity, the
                            students are challenged and engaged through a lot of learning opportunities as our Academy
                            organizes annual programmers that help in developing zeal in being creative, confident and
                            resilient that will ensure an independent and moral way of living in the long run.
                            I am also very fortunate to work with a dedicated, innovative and caring faculty members who
                            have contributed immensely to the well-being of our institution. Apart from academic
                            qualifications, their constant support and encouragement is evident throughout their
                            service. Working and learning together every single day, we strive to provide our students
                            the best environment possible.
                            Welcoming all to the family of Brilliant Academy, I assure never to fail you in any aspect
                            of education that we promise to impart. I hope this prospectus shall give you a deeper
                            insight to all requirements you seek for.
                            Best wishes and regards.

                            Welcome all of you to the new academic session of Brilliant Academy- an institution with
                            difference. We are very happy and thrilled to be partnering with you in establishing an
                            exciting educational journey in fulfilling the dreams of our children. In this journey
                            filled with excitement, we will together engage in a holistic exploration of the education
                            that we promise to impart. With individual care and a friendly environment, we strive to
                            cultivate the working of inherent potentials that exist in every student.
                            Well, in the age of globalization, the world has turned into a village and our institution
                            leaves no stone unturned in propelling the internal and external transformation that shall
                            foster and nurture in the children the ability to fit in globally. Taking in consideration
                            both the modern and traditional ways of imparting knowledge, we strive to give the best of
                            everything that shall definitely contribute to the nation-building. The methodology we adopt
                            encourages the studentsâ€™ imagination to spread wings and not restrict their thought
                            processes. In addition, our school is encompassed with talented, young and well-qualified
                            teachers who pull out all the stops in delivering their sincere service. Thus, we can
                            solemnly vouch for the quality of education that we intend to impart, considering the
                            excellence of our literati.
                            To conclude, we would like to stress on the fact that we work together as an entity in
                            moulding the best possible future for our students. Ergo, it is an earnest appeal to the
                            parents and the students to work together in unity which shall help in achieving the desired
                            and targeted result. Consequently, we believe, it will significantly contribute in creating
                            a better and a healed future for the ailing earth we live in.
                            This brochure will take you on a tour as you will get the glimpses of various activities and
                            the rich diversity of our Academy in fulfilling the dreams of our young hearts.
